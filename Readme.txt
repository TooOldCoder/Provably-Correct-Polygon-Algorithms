Provably Corect Polygon Algorithms
by Tom Wright

Thank for your interest in these algorithms. I am releasing them into the public domain.

They are implemented as a Microsoft Visual C++ console project. The resulting program can be run in the debugger or in a cmd window.

Initially I suggest you arrange things exactly as I have them on my computer so you a build the .exe files (debug and release) and run the test case. To do this copy the PolygonCompareTest to C:\c. Then open C:\c\PolygonCompareTest\PolygonCompareTest.sln. You should then be able to build the .exe files. Then copy Data to C:\. You should then be able to run the test case.
